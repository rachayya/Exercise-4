	<h2>Title 4</h2>
	<p>A wildcard entry into Dries’s keynote and Holly’s closing-note
		at Drupalcon Asia, DCAP made its humble beginnings in one of India’s
		regional events, where business folks were trying to find answers to
		Drupal talent problems. In spirit of Drupal community’s do-ocracy some
		of the community members figured a WIN-WIN solution for the problem,
		that is to take Drupal to colleges and evangelise it professionally.
		There have been numerous college workshops but DCAP is different in
		ways that it provides longevity and support to college students and
		that is exactly what Rakhi will be sharing at Higher-ed summit -- a
		bit of the history, successes so far and brave new world Drupal will
		foray into through DCAP. Catch Rakhi in action on May 9 at DrupalCon
		New Orleans.</p>

	<h2>Title 5</h2>
	<p>Saket is back with a session on the utopia of using Drupal 8 as
		a backend for multiple front end frameworks; this time it’s through
		Polymer. Webcomponents have had the frontend community wanting, what’s
		not to desire? Reusable components, shadow DOM, templating and much
		more all native to the browser. Though webcomponents paints a
		beautiful feature, Polymer from Google delivers it as a polyfill for
		the restless. In this talk Saket will talk about what Drupal 8
		frontend programming might look like and glitches we might need to
		resolve for a smooth future</p>

		<h3>Module</h3>
		<p>We provide both tech consultancy and MVP backlog preparation
			for new projects. Tech consultancy includes technical architecture,
			3rd party integration feasibility study and analysis of technical
			risks. We use our expertise to come up with technical roadmap for the
			project. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) backlog preparation is another
			area where we work with our clients to plot user requests against a
			cost -> benefit graph and then selectively come at MVP that's quick
			to build and launch.that is to take Drupal to colleges and evangelise
			it professionally. There have been numerous college workshops but
			DCAP is different in ways that it provides longevity.
